If you make more changes to your project then _GitHub Desktop_ will show the _Uncommited Changes_ label. You can then pick and choose which files to stage (include), commit those files and push the commit to GitHub (sync).

You are now familiar with the very basics of using Git. There are a lot more features in this powerful tool but we will not be going over them in this tutorial. For now, we want you to get used to the process of committing and pushing changes to your projects as you work on them.

## History and redundancy

This process is super important because it gives you both history and redundancy. Each commit is saved separately with a specific message that describes the changes you have made. You can actually view each commit and see what those changes are. This will save you hours of time in some cases when you are trying to debug a new bug that came from code you added recently.

You also get redundancy. If something were to happen to your computer (the hard drive fails or it is lost/stolen), GitHub will have a copy of it! This of course assumes that you actually *push* your code. So remember, commit often and always push! You'll be glad you did :)

# Your responsibility

Every time you start a new project you should first create a new Git repository. You can always reference the previous page if you forget how.

>It is now your responsibility to:
>
1. Create a repository at the start of every project
2. Commit _and_ push changed files at the end of **every tutorial page**

<!--  -->

> [info]
> Make sure to use descriptive commit messages! They should always fill in the blank for the sentence "This commit will \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_". If the commit adds a README, the commit message should be "Add README". If it implements a new location feature, the commit message should be "Implement location monitoring". If it fixes a bug in user signup from Facebook accounts, the commit message should be "Fixes user signup bug for Facebook accounts".

Doing this will help you develop good habits. When you start your own apps and games you will continue to use Git to track changes and backup your project. Once you start your own projects, you will be committing and pushing every time you finish a small feature. It's important that you commit and push at least once a day. Good developers usually commit and push multiple times a day.
