If you make more changes to your project then SourceTree will show the staging screen again. You can then pick and choose which files to stage, commit those files and push the commit to GitHub.

You are now familiar with the very basics of using Git. There are a lot more features in this powerful tool but we will not be going over them in this tutorial. For now, we want you to get used to the process of committing and pushing changes to your projects as you work on them.

#Your responsibility

Every time you start a new project you should first create a new Git repository. See the previous step if you forget how.

If you create a new repository before creating the actual project, you can then create the project directly in the your new repository folder. This will save you the step of having to move it later!

It is now your responsibility to:

1. Create a repository at the start of every project
2. Stage, commit and push changed files at the end of every tutorial page

> [info]
> Make sure to use descriptive commit messages! For the tutorials it should be a 1-2 sentence summary of what you did while finishing that page. You should do the same for your personal projects.

Doing this will help you develop good habits. When you start your own apps and games you will continue to use Git to track changes and backup your project. Once you start your own projects, you will be committing and pushing every time you finish a small feature. It's important that you commit and push at least once a day. Good developers usually commit and push multiple times a day.
